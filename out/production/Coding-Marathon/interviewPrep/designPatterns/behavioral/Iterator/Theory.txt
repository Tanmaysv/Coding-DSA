Iterators are generally used to tranverse a container to access its elements

1)It is very common design pattern used in collection framework
 -Used to access element of collections object

2)Mostly 2 methods hashNext() and next() are  used

3)This pattern hides the actual implementation of traversal through the collection

Example: Where and why do we use it ?

Supoose we have company A , who stores all the client data in array

Company B , stores it in LinkedList , After few days Company A acquires company B

Here , We dont need to change code to access array or linkedlist .Iterator will access
both Data structures hiding the implementation of accessing
