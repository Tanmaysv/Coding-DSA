In Arrays.sort

1)We can sort in ascending and descending order  Arrays.sort(data, Collections.reverseOrder());
2)Descending order sorting is only available for object types and not primitive

Syntax:
Arrays.sort(data, Collections.reverseOrder());

What can i do if i want reverse sorting ?

multiply the Array by -1
sort
multiply once again with -1
Literally spoken:

array = -Arrays.sort(-array)


When to use Collections.sort() VS Arrays.sort ?

Collections.sort() has a input as List so it does a translation of List to array
and vice versa which is an additional step while sorting.
So this should be used when you are trying to sort a list.


Arrays.sort is for arrays so the sorting is done directly on the array.
So clearly it should be used when you have a array available with you and you want to sort it.
