We have 5 types of inheritance

1)Single Inheritance- One super class one  derived class
2)Multilevel Inheritance- Derived class in inherited from base class , and derived class will asloact as base class to other
3)Hierarchical Inheritance- One super class have multiple base classes
4)Multiple Inheritance (Not posiible in java with classes as baseclass,Possible with Interface as base class)-
More than 1 superclass for a derived class
5)Hybrid Inheritance (Not posiible in java with classes as baseclass,Possible with Interface as base class)-
Mix of  multiple inheritance and Hierarchial

When child class is derived from parent class , variables of parent class becomes private to base class;
