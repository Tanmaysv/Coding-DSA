There are2 ways to implement threads in java

1)Extending Thread class
2)Implementing runnable interface


when to use what Thread class or runable?

1)If you are already extending 1 class , you cannot extend thread class as multiple inheritance is not allowed in java
-So use Runnable (Interface), using runnable you can still extend 1 class

When we extend Thread class, each of our thread creates unique object and associate with it.
When we implements Runnable, it shares the same object to multiple threads.
