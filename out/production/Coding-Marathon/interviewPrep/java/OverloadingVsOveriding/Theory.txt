Overloading Vs Overriding

Overloading:
1) It increases the redability of code
2)Overloading is provided wthin the class
3)For overloading , parameters must be different
4)Return type may or may be different , But paraeters should be different




Overriding
1)It is used to provide specific implementation of the method that is already provided by super class
2)Overrinding occurs in two classes that have IS-A relationship
3)Parameter must be same in overriding
4)Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism.
5)Return type must be same or covariant in method overriding.
 -When we override a parent class method, the name, argument types and return type
  of the overriding method in child class has to be exactly same as that of parent class method.
