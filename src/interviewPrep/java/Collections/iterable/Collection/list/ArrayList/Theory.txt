ArrayList

1)Default capacity of Arraylist and Vector 10
2)ArrayList is not synchronized

ArrayList vs LinkedList

1)Insertion and deletion is O(1) in linkedList and O(n) for arrayList
2)Updating a specific element if we know a index is easy with arrayList
3)O(n) to search element in arraylist and linkedlist
4)However if array is sorted then we can use binary search in arraylist O(logn)

If we want to make arraylist synchronized then ?
Using Collections.synchronizedList() method
Using thread-safe variant of ArrayList which is : CopyOnWriteArrayList

Iterator of CopyOnWriteArrayList is fail-safe and doesn't throw ConcurrentModificationException
even if underlying CopyOnWriteArrayList is modified.
