1)If two Objects are equal, according to the equals(Object) method,
then hashCode() method must produce the same Integer on each of the two Objects.


2)If two Objects are unequal, according to the equals(Object) method,
It is not necessary the Integer value produced by hashCode() method on each of
the two Objects will be distinct. It can be same but producing the distinct Integer on each of the
two Objects is better for improving the performance of hashing based Collections like HashMap, HashTableâ€¦etc.


3)internal consistency: the value of hashCode() may only change if a property that is in equals() changes


4)If we override equals(), we must also override hashCode().
