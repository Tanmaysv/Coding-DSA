String a="1";
String b="1";

a==b ? true or false ?

Generally You will say == COMPARES THE REFERENCE OF OBJECT , and as object object are different it will return false

But , heres the String literal pool Concept , a will point to 1 in string literal pool and b will also point to the same pool
So , same reference and hence equal
