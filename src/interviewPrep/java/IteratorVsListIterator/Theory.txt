Iterator

1)Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
2)Helps to traverse Map, List and Set.
3)Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.
4)Cannot modify or replace elements present in Collection
5)Cannot add elements and it throws ConcurrentModificationException.
6)Certain methods of Iterator are next(), remove() and hasNext().

ListIterator

1)Can traverse elements present in Collection both in forward and backward directions.
2)Can only traverse List and not the other two.
3)It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain indexes of elements at any time while traversing List.
4)We can modify or replace elements with the help of set(E e)
5)Can easily add elements to a collection at any time.
6)Certain methods of ListIterator are next(), previous(), hasNext(), hasPrevious(), add(E e).
