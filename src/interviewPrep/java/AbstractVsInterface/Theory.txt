Abstract Class-

1) Abstract class can extend classes as well as implement Interfaces
2) In Abstract class , methods can or cannot be abstract
3) In Abstract class you can have final , static non static variables
4) You can use public,protected,private access modifier


Interface:

1) Interface can only extend interfaces , it cannot implement classes
2) In Interface all methods are abstract .
3) In Interface , it can have only static final variable
4) Members are public by default


When to use What ?

1) If you have same line of code that are to be shared by 2 or more classes
- Use Abstract class , define method here and let the class extend the abstract class

2)If you need access specifier other then public in sub class or want to define static non static variable
-Use Abstract class

3)If you dont care about the implementation and have diff implementation for each class
-Use Interface

4)If you want to bond a contract that all methods in sub class should be implemented
-Use interface
