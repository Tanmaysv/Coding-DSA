Main advantage of multitasking: Increase performance and reduce ideal time of cpu

Multitasking in java is divided in 2 types:
1)Process-Based
2)Thread-Based

1)Process-Based:

Here each task is seperate individual programme and is OS Dependent
i.e
1)Download filefrom chrome
2)Listem music online
3)Run application on ide

This all 3 task re seperate individual programme


1)Thread-Based:
Here each Thread is run individually and is part of sameprogramme.
One thread can or cannot be dependent on another thread
Thread is programatic level


When to use threading concept?
Wherever we have independent jobs-taks ,use threading concepts

How much threads we can execute at same time?
It depends on cpu core , if 1 core can run 2 threads at a time then 4 core can execute 8 threads at a time
