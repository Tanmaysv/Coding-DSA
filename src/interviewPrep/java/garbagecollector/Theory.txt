An object is said to be eligible for GC(garbage collection) iff it is unreachable
or i.e it is null

There are generally four different ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection.
1)Nullifying the reference variable
2)Re-assigning the reference variable
3)Object created inside method
4)Island of Isolation



How can we call Garbage Collector ?

1)System.gc()
2)Runtime.getRuntime().gc()

*important*
There is no guarantee that any one of above two methods will definitely run Garbage Collector.


Just before destroying an object, Garbage Collector calls ****finalize()**** method on the object to perform
cleanup activities. Once finalize() method completes, Garbage Collector destroys that object
