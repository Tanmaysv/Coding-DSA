This GC Algorithm and contains 2 phases

1)Mark
2)Sweep


1)Mark

1)In this mark phase , the GC sets the value true to the live/reachable objects
2)The marking is done in graph traversal way , Depth-First Search Algorithm
3)Here we can consider every object as a node and then all the nodes (objects) that are reachable from this node (object)
are visited and it goes on till we have visited all the reachable nodes.



2)Sweep Phase

1)Here it sweeps the unreachable object/Unset bits i.e flag=false
2)Also maintains a free-list (LinkedList) of free memory


Disadvantages:
Fragmentation: Free spaces might be in different location
