How to identify heap problems?
-Check in question if it mentions kth smallest or kth largest

If it says
kth smallest-> Use Max Heap
kth Largest->  Use Min Heap

To find kth smallest and largest , what can we do ?
We can sort and find kth element but time complexity is (nlogn)

Can we reduce the time complexity from (nlogn) ?
Yes,Using Heap-> Time complexity -> (nlogk)

How the time complexity becomes (nlogk) ?
because we maintain a heap of k size only and sort k elements only instead of n elements

Example:a[]= 7,10,4,3,20,15 k=3 , find 3th smallest element
Using Sorting Algo: 3 4 7 10 15 20 (nlogn)

maintain a maxHeap of k size , keep on adding elemets to it
if size becomes greater then k , then pop()
at the end the top most element is kth smallest
